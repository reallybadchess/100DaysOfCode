SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
WHERE amount NOT IN (174, 87, 477)
GROUP BY customer_id;
-- Instead we can try
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(amount) > 100;
-- All sums are now greater than 100
-------------------------
--Using HAVING with a COUNT call
SELECT store_id, COUNT(customer_id) 
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id;
-- Gives a count of customers per store

---------------
-- Now selecting only stores that have > 300 customers
SELECT store_id, COUNT(customer_id)
FROM customer
GROUP BY store_id
HAVING COUNT(customer_id) > 300;
