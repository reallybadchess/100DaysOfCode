-- Using WHERE
-- #####################

-- WHERE allows for specific conditions to queries
-- Can limit the results that only satisfy the conditions
-- Filter rows on data by running condidtions
-- We use the WHERE clause in conjunction with operators (Comparison, Logical, Arithmatic)

/*

SELECT
	column_list
FROM table_name
WHERE
	conditions

*/

-- WHERE with operators (AND | OR)

-- First a single condition
